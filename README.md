# Project description

Welcome to this creative project I made for term one. It is an electrical firework installation with out using real fire to lit.
It is based on the background that in Chinese, these days in most city, people are not allowed to set off fireworks because it will polluting the air and may cause fire hazard, however it is our tradition to set fireworks to celebrate new year. So I want to make an electrical fireworks installation so that people can enjoy any time any where.

The whole interaction process can be divided into three main parts.First is how to light the fake fire. Second is how to show fireworks. Finallyï¼Œ how to extinguish the fake fire. To answer these questions. I used four inputs which are button status, Microphone sensor value, NFC tag UID number and light value read by light conrolled resistor and four outputs including includes LED, wss2818b LED strip, ST7735 screen, DF MP3 palyer. 

The first part has one pair of input and output is button and LED. Press the button to start the LED which represents fake fire. The second part is to show fireworks. ST7735 OLED screen was chosen to show animation of fireworks as output and there is an DF player can play sound of fireworks exploded as anouther output.
